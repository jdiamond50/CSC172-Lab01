This lab was involved a review of Java generics and how generics can be used to implement methods that can potentially take a variety of classes as inputs. This was illustrated with the `printArray()` and `getMax()` methods and contrasted with other means of taking in multiple classes as input, such as having a parameter of type Object (or an Object array) and method overloading.
