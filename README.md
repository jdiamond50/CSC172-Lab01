CSC 172 Lab 1
This lab covered a review of Java generics and lambda expressions implementing a functional interface. Various arrays of objects were printed with multiple methods and the maximum value of these arrays was also found with a variety of methods. The PrintArray java file holds the source code for the lab and the OUTPUT file displays the code's output.
